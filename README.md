# ImageArchiver


Checks your ComicSuite/RMS/RMH database to see if the item is in the Items list.  
It also checks to see if the item on the orderform is past the FOC date.  
If the item is not in the Item table, and if the item is in DCDOrderform and past the FOC/OIC date, the image will be moved to the Archives folder.
